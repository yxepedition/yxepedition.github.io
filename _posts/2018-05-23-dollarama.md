## Am I poor or am I smart?

I think it's a mixture of both. Some really good stuff is available at quite affordable prices at Dollarama. It's great for getting souvenirs for kith and kin<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a>. <!--more--> For instance, I spent around 20 CAD and got all these along with some cookies, garbage bags and sugar. Not bad at all, eh?

## I'll be going there again

Most of the items that I buy here, I may not even be able to carry it home. I am all for no compromise on quality but to be frank, the quality of the products do seem good. No matter what, I think places like **Dollarama** and **Dollar Tree** are the only places you, as an Indian, can do the CAD to INR conversions.

###### Footnotes
* [<a id="note1" href="#note1ref">1</a>] : If any of my kith and kin is reading this post and feeling cheated that I got them stuff from Dollarama, I would like to remind them that 1 CAD is over 50 INR and not everything at Dollarama is 1 CAD (the keychains were 1.5 CAD).
