This is located in **Saskatchewan Hall**. The Residence Services team has played a crucial role in getting our Accommodation related issues sorted out. They are very quick with mails and the people involved are really nice (sort of a given since this is Canada). This was the first on-campus place I visited after arriving at Saskatoon. And I visit the place nearly thrice each week. Why? Good question. <!--more-->

Though I arrived on a Saturday, my move-in process was smooth. I got my **Temp Card**, room keys and post box keys. But the problem was that I got a _Temp Card_, not my Student ID Card (which needed some more processing). And I have _extended_ the validity of this temp card at least three times, till I got my Student ID. Apart from this, I also visit them to ask questions about paying rent, getting the RCC<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> amount credited etcâ€¦ Though I did have valid reasons to go back to this place often, there's still one more thing that this place represents to me.

It is a key landmark in my **Tunnel** explorations. As you might see in my other tunnel related posts (_insert links_), I enjoy exploring the tunnel network. Seeing **Saskatchewan Hall** and the Residences Services Office is a happy reminder that I know exactly where I am. It acted as something like an anchor, especially during **The Long Tour By Foot** (_insert link_).

Now that I got my Student Card, I might be going there much less. But who knows?

###### Footnotes
* [<a id="note1" href="#note1ref">1</a>] : RCC money is something that's "given" to everyone staying in one of the university residences and can be accessed through the student card. It is accepted in most campus food outlets.
