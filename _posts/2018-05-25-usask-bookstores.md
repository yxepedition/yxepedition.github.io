## Their Gurunath is like Odyssey!

For the uninitiated, there are some explanations for the sub-title <a href="#note1" id="note1ref">here</a>. Simply put, the bookstore here is serene, beautifully organised, also pretty darn expensive (to me, at least). <!--more-->They have U of S merchandise, including clothings, soft toys and collectibles. They also have stationery, books and art supplies. I wanted to buy some notepads with the University insignia on it, but they were around 8-10 CAD. I decided, with a depressed sigh, that maybe I won't get them. Until I found thatâ€¦

## There are many branches!

There are around 6 different branches of the store across campus and the one at the **Agriculture and Bioresources** building has the same things available at a cheaper rate! Who would have thought? I grabbed one of the U of S folders for half price and my friend Saurabh got himself a really good sweater for half price. It was our lucky day!

Maybe there are even better deals in the other branches? I'm going to be on the lookout for sure!
