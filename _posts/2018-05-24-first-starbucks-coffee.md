## Finally, I did it!

As I came to the library to return my Agatha Christie graphic novel, I decided to spend the rest of the morning in the library ambience. On the way to "my spot" in the fifth floor, I finally made the decision to stop at Starbucks on the ground floor to try out my very first Starbucks Coffee. It's a ***Vanilla Latte Grande*** for **$5.50**.

## I was a bit stupid.

Reading the title, before you think I am about to say something about the price or anything bad about the coffee, let me assure you that's not where I am going; I am not *that* stupid. My stupidity was reflected in how I managed to add accessories like the cardboard that lets you hold your cup, the cap, and so on. I forgot that the cap was designed to make the coffee drinkable directly (I know you've seen this in every movie or TV show, don't judge). I took two straws thinking one of them will fit and ended up wasting them (sorry Mother Earth, I'll be more careful next time with decisions involving plastics). In the end, I managed to walk away with this :

## Verdict

I feel very rich, having just spent so much money on coffee (full disclosure, contrary to stereotypical expectations, I am not really that big of a coffee fan). I also feel nice, I can finally say I have walked to my library seat with a Starbucks cup in my hand to get me through work.
