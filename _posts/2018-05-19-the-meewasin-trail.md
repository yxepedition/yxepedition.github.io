## The River

The **South Saskatchewan River** flows through Saskatoon, cutting the city into two parts, paving the way to lots of bridges, and hence giving the city the nickname ***The Paris of the Prairies*** <a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> . <!--more--> The **Meewasin Trail** is a road that runs parallel to the river on both sides, where cyclists and pedestrians can enjoy a long walk along the river. More details about the Meewasin Trail can be found on the its official website <a href="https://meewasin.com" alt="meewasin website" target="_blank">here</a>. The river (and therefore the trail) is very close to the campus. 

## The Trail

The trail is admittedly pretty. I would not say it's the most beautiful riverbank I have been to, but it is worth it. Around 9 of us went on a small expedition. Around 5 of us decided to go "adventurous" and the remaining 4 went "scenic". I was obviously with the "scenic" party. Taking our time to take photos and chill (and cross two bridges), we went on for nearly 4 hours, basking in the evening sunshine.

We met many kinds of birds and animals (I am not a bird watcher nor am I adept with animal names, so, apologies for the generic terms). We also met a lot of cyclists and people on skateboards. Being Indians, we tended to stick to the left on the trail, but people here stick to the right. I had to constantly nag my companions to move against their instincts (naturally, to their annoyance).

From one of the bridges we crossed (a railway bridge), we could get the signature view of Saskatoon.

The river, the bridges, the small island in the middle. The second bridge was newer and the "scenic" group can be seen here.

Overall, it was a fun trip. I would probably go back once more to the place, just to sit for a while and relax.

###### Footnotes
* [<a id="note1" href="#note1ref">1</a>] : I have been to real *Paris, France*, and to be frank, apart from the river, there's not much of a similarity between the two places. One other exception could be the castle-like buildings inside the University Campus.
