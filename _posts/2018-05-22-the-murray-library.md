## The library is huge!

Thought I had spent about an hour in the library *the other day (insert link)*, I hadn't really explored the whole place. So when I felt a bit lethargic at the **Engineering Library**, I made my way to the **Murray Library**, the largest one on campus. First of all, there are 6 floors and each of them has long rows and rows of tall shelves, all filled with books. <!--more-->

As I moved from floor to floor, trying to figure out which would be the ideal places to sit, I almost fainted looking at the books. It was literally like a dream come true, though the library was primarily for Social Sciences, not even my field. There's the smell of old books throughout the library (*Is this heaven?*). The library is old too, there is no denying that. But something about all the old buildings (that look like castles) in U of S reminds me of Hogwarts.

## Food is allowed!

One of the largest signs welcoming us to the library back at IIT Madras is something that reads "No food items allowed". I always found that a bit unfortunate, but I think people are way more careful here than there, so I see a point. Here, everyone's allowed to bring their food inside, also their bags. I see people eating/drinking everything from Coffee to Guacamole.

## The seats are supreme

There is a plug point near almost 70% of the seats. Along the windows, the seats are organised such that you can have a cubicle for yourself. There's even a place to hang your coat and shelves to keep your things.

I guess I don't get to see the actual scene during the winter season, I believe the snow demands that such options exist. The view out of the window is beautiful too. I see the Canadian flag fly high in the nearby **Thorvaldson Building**, just serene.

The **Quiet Zone** in the 6th floor is just perfect for those afternoons where you need absolute peace to get your work done. There are sofas nearly everywhere, for those longing comfort. I'm going to make this place my home how much ever I can.
