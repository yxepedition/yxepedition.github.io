## Yay, Subway!

One of the first things that struck me when I checked out on the Culinary Services page in the USask website was the presence of a Subway outlet within the campus. Being a rather ardent fan of Subs (even if it is not an authentic one, courtesy WOSS<a href="#note1" id="note1ref"><sup>1</sup></a> ). To my delight, I discovered that there is not just one, but two of them very close to where I live. <!--more--> One of them accepts payments using my Student Card, which is great. Got a Panini Triple Cheese Sandwich today (sadly without sauces, but with loads of Jalapeno). However, I didn't pay attention to my good food after sometime because of the discussion that ensued.

## Lunch-time Discussions

One of my lunch-time companions was Anna, a Masters student at U of S. She had brought her own lunch. While we were casually discussing how expensive it is to eat outside everyday, even if it's just one meal, I asked her if she gets paid enough through her scholarship. The short answer - **NO WAY**!

## Man, Grad School is expensive!

One of the things I took for granted was the "full tuition fee waiver" for Ph.D students. But turns out that's not the case. You get paid less and you also need to pay tuition fees. Ph.D. students don't even have to take classes, I wonder why it's called "tuition fees" then. But terminology apart, this just gets me thinking that there are a lot of things to consider before making a decision about grad schools. I not only got food for my hunger, but also lots of "Food for Thought"<a href="#note2" id="note2ref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
