## The first shopping trip

I was supposed to go shopping the day I landed, but since I slept off, I went the next day. Met Claudia, a fellow GRI from Mexico. Both of us were dropped off by our Globalink Mentor, Jackie, at **The Real Canadian Superstore** on 8th Street, Saskatoon. We quickly got ourselves (an abnormally shapped) trolley and went in. 

## The "super"-ness of the Superstore

I have been to some supermarkets in India but the ones I have been to have been the rather small ones, I think. I needed simple things like soap, shampoo, bread etcâ€¦ and I was made to stand there looking puzzled nearly everywhere. First thing was the "pricetags". They are simply _absent_. Instead of being on the products themselves, they can be found on the shelves instead. Took me a while to find them first, but that's just my folly.

As I walked along rows and rows of similar and similarly priced things, I was able to make my decisions only after loads of thinking. Sometimes, inspite of this patient decision making, I found better suited things in some other aisle (*shrug*). After "shopping" for hours, I spent close to 70 CAD, quite a lot of money. Hopefully, it's just the "set-up" cost, as I may not have to buy things like soap and shampoo again.

## Walmart, where were you?

After our [Meewasin Exploration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-05-19-the-meewasin-trail %}), we went to Walmart. My friend told me there was McDonald's there (there's a footnote <a href="#note1" id="note1ref">here</a> for vegetarians). This is the first time I ever entered a Walmart outlet in my life and humongours doesn't even get close to describing it. There's loads and loads of stuff. You need the time, patience and money. I am sure there are bigger Walmart outlets, but this one would do for me.

I returned to Walmart once more the following week, this time along with Jackie, Claudia and Jazmin (another fellow GRI from Mexico). We spent 3 hours there but I felt good about my choices. I think I'm getting better at shopping. 

Overall, I feel there's a lot of "super" options to buy stuff here. But if you're from India, don't convert the price to INR. Just don't.

* [<a id="note1" href="#note1ref">1</a>] : You don't have any veggie options in McD Canada. Don't fall for "The Cheeseburger", that's chicken too. You may eat french fries, flurries and drink unlimited carbonated drinks (for a minimal fee).
